# Classic C
ad-fontes c education

## Explanation

This repository is part of my **Classical Programming** journey, where I learn programming languages through minimal and focused examples. For an overview of the approach, check out the main repository [classical_programming](https://github.com/krisyotam/classical_programming). 

In this repository, you will find **120-second visual examples** explaining core concepts in **C programming**. These quick, concise introductions are followed by **implementation exercises**, where I apply the concepts learned, and further **reading materials** for deeper exploration.

The goal is to grasp the fundamentals of C programming efficiently, with just enough depth to build a solid foundation.

## Process 

Notes are originally taken in [Kortex](https://kortex.co) my markdown editor of choice which allows seamless template files for organization. Content is later stored here.

## Updates

- **December 17, 2024**: Started the Classic C journey with basic setup and initial visual examples.
- **To be updated**: Progressing through core C concepts, adding hands-on exercises.

## Progress

- **Current status**: In Progress
